## Introduction
Initial think-pair-share on machine learning is very short.

For the housing example, the instructor will recreate the table on the board and collect the data from the participants.
Write the answers on the board.
Provide one example feature, then open the discussion for others.
Select two features that will work well for the classification example.

## T cells
When training classifiers, train one type of classifier together.
Point out where the accuracy is in the table and how it is derived from the confusion matrix.
Then have participants try more classifiers.
Ask the participants who obtained the best accuracy and what settings they used.

## Decision Trees
The house price example is more like a regression example than classification, but we use it because it is very intuitive.
