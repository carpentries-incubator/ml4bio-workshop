The Machine Learning for Biology (ml4bio) workshop is aimed at biologists with no previous machine learning experience.
This is a conceptual workshop designed to teach machine learning literacy.
After the workshop, the participants will be able to define machine learning concepts like samples, features, training set, validation set, test set, evaluation metrics, and model selection.
The participants will be able to interactively develop an understanding of machine learning classifiers commonly used in biology like decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and neural networks.
The focus will be on problems in biology where machine learning is effectively used. 

**Please note that the workshop materials for ml4bio are still in development.
Feedback is welcome in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/gitter-lab/ml-bio-workshop/issues).**

> ## Getting Started
>
> This is not a programming workshop.
> You will not be taught how to code.
> This is a beginners workshop in machine learning literacy that will help you understand machine learning concepts.
> The final goal of this workshop is to provide the participants with enough resources to enable them to engage in conversations about machine learning, read articles that use machine learning, and understand the research methodology.
> This is an applied workshop. It uses point-and-click software without requiring any coding skills.
> This workshop focuses on supervised machine learning.
> 
> To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](setup.html) page to 
> get access to the required software and data for this workshop.
