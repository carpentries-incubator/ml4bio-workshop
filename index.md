# Learning Objectives for ML4bio workshop

1. Identify current problems in computational biology and recognize the benefits of machine learning techniques.

2. Comprehend how the datasets are preprocessed, what are samples, features and class labels, what is a model in machine learning, what is training set, hyperparameters, validation set, evaluation and prediction, and how to perform model selection.

3. Compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning classifiers commonly used in biology - logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Assess model selection and recognize that these methods don't necessarily work right out of the box.

4. Discuss applying, updating, and evaluating a trained model on new data.

5. Select and evaluate a model on a sample dataset. Understand the models' complexity and limitations.

6. Read papers that apply ML to biological problems and judge whether ML has been used appropriately and effectively. Focus on the problems in biology that apply ML.

**Please note that workshop materials for ml-4-bio are still in testing. **


> ## Getting Started
>
> This is not a coding workshop. You will not be taught how to code. This is a conceptual beginners workshop in machine learning literacy, that will help you understand machine learning concepts. The final goal of this workshop is to provide the participants with enough resources to enable them to engage in the conversation about machine learning, read articles and understand the research methodology, and finally, provide resources for further specializing in the topic. This is an applied workshop, and it uses point-and-click software, without requiring any coding skills. This workshop will be focusing on supervised machine learning.
> 
> To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](setup.html) tab to 
> get access to the required software and data for this workshop.
