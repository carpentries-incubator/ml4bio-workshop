Data Carpentryâ€™s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working
with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop
teaches data management and analysis for genomics research including: 
best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, use of command-line 
utilities, use of command-line tools to analyze sequence quality and
perform variant calling, and connecting to and using cloud computing. This workshop is designed to 
be taught over two full days of instruction.

**Please note that workshop materials for ml-4-bio are still in testing. **
