The Machine Learning for Biologists (ML4Bio) workshop is aimed at biologists with no previous machine learning experience and minimal computational experience.
This workshop is designed to teach machine learning concepts, not how to implement machine learning models.
After the workshop, participants will be able to define machine learning concepts like samples, features, training set, validation set, test set, evaluation metrics, and model selection.
Participants will be able to interactively develop an understanding of machine learning classifiers commonly used in biology like decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and neural networks.
The focus will be on problems in biology where machine learning is effectively used. 

**The ML4Bio workshop materials are still in development.
Feedback is welcome in the [GitHub issues]({{ site.github.issues_url }}).**

> ## Getting Started
>
> This is not a programming workshop.
> You will not be taught how to code or implement machine learning models.
> This workshop can help you understand machine learning concepts.
> The goal is to provide you with resources to enable you to engage in conversations about machine learning, read articles that use machine learning, and understand the research methodology at a high level.
> The workshop uses point-and-click software without requiring any coding.
> This workshop focuses on supervised machine learning and classification.
> 
> To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](setup.html) page to 
> access the required software and data for this workshop.
