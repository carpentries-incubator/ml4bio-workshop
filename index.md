The Machine Learning for Biology (ml4bio) workshop is aimed at biologists with no previous machine learning experience.
This is the conceptual workshop designed to teach machine learning literacy.
As the outcome of the workshop, the participants will be able to define machine learning and have comprehensive knowledge about concepts like samples, features, machine learning workflow, the training set and validation set, evaluation and prediction, and how to perform model selection.
The participants will be able to interactively develop an understanding of machine learning classifiers commonly used in biology like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.
The focus will be on problems in biology where machine learning is effectively used. 

**Please note that the workshop materials for ml4bio are still in development.
Feedback is welcome in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/gitter-lab/ml-bio-workshop/issues).**


> ## Getting Started
>
> This is not a coding workshop.
> You will not be taught how to code.
> This is a conceptual beginners workshop in machine learning literacy that will help you understand machine learning concepts.
> The final goal of this workshop is to provide the participants with enough resources to enable them to engage in the conversation about machine learning, read articles and understand the research methodology, and finally, provide resources for further specializing in the topic.
> This is an applied workshop. It uses point-and-click software, without requiring any coding skills.
> This workshop will be focusing on supervised machine learning.
> 
> To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](setup.html) tab to 
> get access to the required software and data for this workshop.
