### What is the Decision Tree

Decision trees are part of the CART(Classification and Regression Trees) algorithms. The decision trees are very intuitive and one of the benefits is that we can clearly see the path we took to get to the final answer. We can follow through the whole procedure. This is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms, and it is very intuitive. They are also used across many industries from finances to industrial engineering. For example, a doctor might use a decision tree to decide which medicine to prescribe. Or whether or not a customer qualifies for a credit card. Or in the case of T-cells, whether or not a cell is active or quescent.

### About the Algorithm

Decision tree is a supervised learning classifier. It splits the initial population depending on the a certain condition. The goal of the classifier is the predict the class label on a new set of data.

**How do we choose this classifier?**

Pros of this algorithm:
- easy to understand - no need to have technical knowledge to understand decision trees
- easy to find the rules

Cons:

> ## Conceptual Questions
>
> What are we trying to predict? 
> What features do we have for those predictions? What is the rule?
> How would the decision tree look graphically?

So, let's load a T-cells #2 data set into our software. Follow the procedure previously given to set up your decision tree model.
