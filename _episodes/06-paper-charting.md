title: "Understanding Machine Learning Literature"
length: 60 minutes
questions:
- How are machine learning workflows presented in research papers?
objectives:
- Assess a typical machine learning methodology presented in an academic paper
keypoints:
- Research workflows for machine learning are often not straightforward
- Published papers often omit details which can make it difficult to evaluate machine learning workflows
- Machine learning is used in a large variety of ways in biology
---

This lesson will focus on understanding and evaluation machine learning workflows as they are presented in the literature. 
For this lesson, __we request that you bring a paper from your field which involves machine learning for day 2__.

We will be exploring filling out  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitter-lab/ml-bio-workshop/gh-pages/assets/assessmentChartV2Form.pdf">  this chart </a> for the paper you select. 

## Choosing a paper to bring

Ideally, this paper will use supervised learning in some form. 
While the paper should contain a classification or regression task, this task does not have to be the main goal of the paper. 
If the paper you choose has multiple machine learning models or tasks, choose one of them to focus on. 

Terms to look out for when searcher for a paper are terms related to the machine learning workflow such as training, testing, holdout, features, classifier, or regression. 
You can also looks for the name of and specific classifier, such as random forest or neural network. 
Papers which use deep learning methods are also usable for this activity.

It's okay if the paper is not an exact fit, especially if it is a technique used in your field which you want to understand.

### Example/Backup Papers

Here is a list of papers which are good examples for this activity. 
If you're struggling to find a paper, you can use of of these instead.

- [Classification of human genomic regions based on experimentally determined binding sites of more than 100 transcription-related factors](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2012-13-9-r48#Sec21)

### Example Chart

Here is an example partially filled-out chart from Predictive Models for [Breast Cancer Susceptibility from Multiple Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms](https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/10/8/2725.full.pdf). 
Note that this paper uses 3 different classifiers, but we are just going to focus on the decision tree:

> ## Example Chart Activity
>
> Look in the paper for where the filled in parts of the chart came from.
>
> Based on the paper and the filled out parts of the chart, try to fill in the conclusion section.
