Random forest is a classifier that is made of the large number of decision trees.
Each decision tree in the forest gives the prediction, and the class that the most decision trees predicted 

**How do we choose a classifier?** (finish)

### Step 1 Select Data

Let's load a T-cells #3 data set into our software.
This dataset is engineered specifically for the decision tree classifier.
Please note, that the prediction metrix for this dataset would rarely reflect the real-world data.

> What are we trying to predict? 
> What is the decision rule?
> How would the random forest look graphically?

Sample answer for the visual


### Step 2 Train Classifiers

In this workshop not all of the hyperparameters from the software will be covered.
Those that we don't cover, we will be using the default settings. 
- Skip criterion
- N-estimator - # decision trees that go into forest
- Max-features not so important
- Bootstrap not essential 


### Step 3 Test and Predict

**Finish once the dataset is done**

###  Application in biology
