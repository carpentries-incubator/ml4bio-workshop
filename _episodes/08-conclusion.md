### Reviewing a published workflow

We will review a machine learning workflow from a publication to see how well you can identify the major elements that were presented during this workshop.

### Post-workshop survey

We greatly appreciate your feedback to help improve this workshop.
Please take 10 minutes to complete the anonymous post-workshop survey using the link you were provided.

### Additional resources

The [References][lesson-reference] page links to additional resources on machine learning concepts and introductory tools.
It includes a Jupyter notebook that shows Python code to execute the type of machine learning workflow you ran with the ml4bio software.
The [Glossary][lesson-glossary] contains definitions of the machine learning terms used in this workshop.
You can also use the additional real and simulated datasets that you downloaded to continue exploring how compatible different types of classifiers are with different data patterns.
