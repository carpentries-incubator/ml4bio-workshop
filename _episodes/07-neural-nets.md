**How do we choose a classifier?** 


### Step 1 Select Data

Let's load a T-cells #5 data set into our software. This dataset is engineered specifically for the decision tree classifier. Please note, that the prediction metrix for this dataset would rarely reflect the real-world data. 

> ## Conceptual Questions

> What are we trying to predict? 
> What is the decision rule?
> How would the neural networks look graphically?

Sample answer for the visual


### Step 2 Train Classifiers

#### Hyperparameters

- Num_hidden_units 
- Activation
- Alpha


### Step 3 Test and Predict

**Finish once the dataset is done**

###  Application in biology
