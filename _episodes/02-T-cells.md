Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses the bodyâ€™s own immune cells to boost natural defenses against cancer, and T cells are a popular target for immunotherapies. To fully optimize the effect of immunotherapy, T cell activation must be assessed at a single-cell level. Melissa Skala's group developed a label-free and non-destructive autofluorescence imaging method to easily and quickly acquire T cell intensity images. Therefore, an activated/quiescent (inactive) T cell classifier that uses autofluorescence intensity images can contribute to the applications of immunotherapy.

### Dataset description

This microscopy dataset includes gray scale images of two type of T cells: activated and quiescent (not activated). These T cells come from 6 donors.

Since WARF team is filing a patent for this study, we can only make these subsampled images public.

### Machine Learning Methods

The goal of this study is to develop a method to classify T cell activation stage (activated vs. quiescent). 

### ML4Bio software setup

We will be using ML4 Bio software. Refer to the [Setup](https://gitter-lab.github.io/ml-bio-workshop/setup.html) for instructions on how to install and launch the software. 

## Machine Learning workflow (Make our own version of this)

### Data Preprocessing 

The first step in machine learning would be to prepare our data. Preprocessing the raw data is an important step in order to have quality data for the model. There are methods and tools that are used for data normalization and preprocessing. However, learning these methods and tools is not one of the objectives of the workshop. So, we will assume that all of the data has already been preprocessed.

### Training set vs. Validation set vs. Test set 

The preprocessed dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The training set is further split into a training set and a validation set.

#### Training set 

The training set is a part of the original dataset that trains or fits the model. This is the data that the model uses to learn.

#### Validation set

Further, a part of the training set is used for validation of the fitted model. This is not the final evaluation of the model. This step is used to change hyperparameters and then train the model again.  We will be using the holdout validation method in the software. We will use the default 20% of the training set for the validation set.

#### Test set

 The test set checks how well the model works on the new data. The test set is used in the final phase of the workflow, and it evaluates the final model.
