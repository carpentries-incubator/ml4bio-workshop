### Model Selection

Choosing the proper machine learning model for a given task requires knowledge of both machine learning models and the domain of the task.
Finding _the best_ model for a new task in machine learning is often a research question in itself.
Finding a model that performs _reasonably well_, however, can often be accomplished by carefully considering the task domain and a little trial and error with the validation set.

Some of the questions to consider when choosing a model are:

* How much data is there to train with?
* Does the data contain about the same number of each class?
* How many features does the dataset have? Are all of the features relevant, or might some of them not be related to the data's class?
* What types are the features (numeric, categorical, image, text)?
* What might the decision boundary look like? Is the data likely linearly separable?
* How noisy is the data?

### Reviewing a published workflow

We will review a machine learning workflow from a publication to see how well you can identify the major elements that were presented during this workshop.

### Post-workshop survey

We greatly appreciate your feedback to help improve this workshop.
Please take 10 minutes to complete the anonymous post-workshop survey using the link you were provided.

### Additional resources

The [References][lesson-reference] page links to additional resources on machine learning concepts and introductory tools.
It includes a Jupyter notebook that shows Python code to execute the type of machine learning workflow you ran with the ml4bio software.
The [Glossary][lesson-glossary] contains definitions of the machine learning terms used in this workshop.
You can also use the additional real and simulated datasets that you downloaded to continue exploring how compatible different types of classifiers are with different data patterns.
