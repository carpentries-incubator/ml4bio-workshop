## Glossary and other resources

The [Google machine learning glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary) and [ml4bio guides](https://github.com/gitter-lab/ml-bio-workshop/tree/gh-pages/guide) define common machine learning terms.

The [scikit-learn tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) provide a Python-based introduction to machine learning.
There is also a third-party [scikit-learn tutorial](https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial).

The book Python Machine Learning has machine learning [example code](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition).

The [Elements of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/) course presents general introductory materials to machine learning and related topics.

[Galaxy ML](https://galaxyproject.org/community/machine-learning/) provides access to classification and regression workflows through the Galaxy interface.

The workshop organizers track additional resources for [beginners](https://github.com/gitter-lab/ml-bio-workshop/issues/43) and [intermediate users](https://github.com/gitter-lab/ml-bio-workshop/issues/94).

Training classifiers for a research project typically requires training many models and tuning their hyperparameters on a validation dataset.
Writing scripts helps automate this process, document the training and tuning decisions, and improve reproducibility.
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) introduces strategies for script-driven research.
A computing cluster helps train and evaluate many machine learning models in parallel.

## Jupyter notebook example

You can [run an example Jupyter notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gitter-lab/ml-bio-workshop/gh-pages?filepath=illustration.ipynb) in Binder to see how a machine learning workflow looks in Python code using scikit-learn.
The notebook will load an executable Python environment in your web browser.
After it loads, you can inspect the code and output or rerun it yourself.
