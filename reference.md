## Glossary and other resources

The [Google machine learning glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary) and [ml4bio guides]({{ repo_url }}/blob/{{ source_branch }}/guide) define common machine learning terms.

The [Elements of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/) course presents general introductory materials to machine learning and related topics.

## Jupyter notebook example

You can [run an example Jupyter notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gitter-lab/ml-bio-workshop/gh-pages?filepath=illustration.ipynb) in Binder to see how a machine learning workflow looks in Python code using scikit-learn.
