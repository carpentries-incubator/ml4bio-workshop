# Invitation to join ml4bio workshop

Dear `name`,
My research group is developing a workshop that teaches essential machine learning concepts to biological scientists without computational backgrounds.  The workshop provides motivating examples from biological case studies and demonstrates how to train a machine learning classifier, how to evaluate it correctly, and what common pitfalls to avoid.  The objectives are to help participants:
- consider how machine learning could be applicable in their research
- better understand literature in their field that involves machine learning
- become more comfortable with machine learning terminology

I’m seeking participants who are excited to pilot test an early version of the workshop.  No programming or statistics experience is required.  We have a point-and-click graphical interface that participants will use to interactively work through a machine learning pipeline on their own laptops.  The next pilot workshop will be held on `date-time` at `location`.

Because the workshop development is NSF-funded, we require all workshop participants to:
- complete pre- and post-workshop surveys (~5-10 min each)
- follow our guide to install the Python-based software on your laptop before the workshop (~15-30 min)

If you are interested in the workshop but unable to attend on `date`, please let me know so that I can add you to a contact list for future workshop sessions.
