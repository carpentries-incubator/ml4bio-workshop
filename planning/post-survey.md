## Post-workshop survey questions

1. Did the workshop meet your expectations?
2. Which of your workshop expectations were not met?

3. How comfortable would you be training classifiers for a research project? (1-3)
- 1: Uncomfortable, wouldn't know where to start
- 3: Completely comfortable, would require no outside help
    
4. How confident would you be reviewing a paper in your field which uses machine learning BEFORE taking this workshop?
- 1: Uncomfortable, wouldn't know where to start
- 3: Completely comfortable, would require no outside help

5. How confident would you be reviewing a paper in your field which uses machine learning AFTER taking this workshop?
- 1: Uncomfortable, wouldn't know where to start
- 3: Completely comfortable, would require no outside help
	
6. How would you rate your knowledge of machine learning BEFORE taking this workshop?
- 1: None little or no knowledge of machine learning
- 5: Very knowledgable of machine learning

7. How would you rate your knowledge of machine learning AFTER taking this workshop?
- 1: None little or no knowledge of machine learning
- 5: Very knowledgable of machine learning

8. Imagine that in your research, you encountered a problem well-suited to machine learning.
- How condfident are you that BEFORE this workshop you would identfy the problem as being well-suited to machine learning?
- How condfident are you that AFTER this workshop you would identfy the problem as being well-suited to machine learning?
- How likely would you be to persue machine learning for that problem BEFORE this workshop?
- How likely would you be to persue machine learning for that problem AFTER this workshop?
	
9. Which workshop topics were most valuable for you?
10. Which workshop topics would be difficult for you to explain to a friend at a high level?
11. How was the pace of the workshop?
	
12. Please rate the amount of time spent:
- Using the software
- Viewing the website
- Interacting with the workshop organizers
- In breakout rooms
- Discussing math and computational background
- Presenting biological motivation and examples
- Presenting the machine learning workflow
- Presenting specific classifiers

13. What research questions do you want to answer with the data you collect or analyze?
14. What questions about machine learning do you have that were not addressed during the workshop?
15. Please share any other suggestions for improving the workshop, ml4bio software, website, guides, or other materials.
16. Was there any information you wish you had before the workshop?
