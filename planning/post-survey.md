Imagine that in your research, you encountered a problem well-suited to machine learning.
	1a. How condfident are you that BEFORE this workshop you would identfy the problem as being well-suited to machine learning?
	1b. How condfident are you that AFTER this workshop you would identfy the problem as being well-suited to machine learning?
	2a. How likely would you be to persue machine learning for that problem BEFORE this workshop?
	2b.How likely would you be to persue machine learning for that problem AFTER this workshop?
