This directory contains published biological datasets. The size of these datasets are appropriate for educational purposes. Each subdirectory contains a collection of datasets and its associated paper. The datasets contain all needed information for building a classfier, but need some preprocessing before being fed to the GUI. Details about model building can be found in the correponding paper.
